                <p>"Programming isn't about what you know; it's about what you can figure out.‚Äù</p>

                <p>Technology has always interested and fascinated me since a young age. That's why when I first left college in 2012, I began teaching myself how to read, write, and understand code. Along that journey, I became very interested in iPhone application development and went on to take a bootcamp at DigitalCrafts where I earned a certificate in iOS Mobile Engineering.</p>
                        
                <p>Wanting to learn more about programming and other languages, I decided to go back to school in 2016. I attended Georgia Military College and graduated with an Associate Degree in Computer Science in 2018. There, I learned two more programming languages: Java and Python, as well as the concept of Data Structures. Since then, I have continued my education on my own by starting to dive into Web Development, teaching myself the basics of HTML and CSS. Currently, I am enrolled in another bootcamp that is based around Full Stack Web Development and is run through Georgia Tech, where we are learning HTML and CSS on a more advanced level, as well as JavaScript, Node.js, MySQL, along with other libraries, frameworks, and runtime environments.</p>
                        
                <p>I have always been an inquisitive and curious person with a thirst for knowledge in topics that interest me. I love a good challenge, and enjoy problem-solving that requires me to find the solutions to difficult problems. I am excited to put all that I've learned to use, as well as to continue my learning by joining the ever-growing IT industry.</p>
